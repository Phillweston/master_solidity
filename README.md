# Solidity Examples

1. Take the individual examples and copy/paste them into [remix.ethereum.org](remix.ethereum.org).
2. Compile them using a compiler version higher than 0.8.0
3. Deploy and test

## Course Overview

1. [Counter](examples/1_Counter.sol)
    
    It shows how to read from and write to state variables, which is a fundamental aspect of smart contract development.
2. [Variables](examples/2_Variables.sol)
    
    It covers basic data types, more complex structures, and the distinction between state and local variables.
3. [Arrays](examples/3_Arrays.sol)
    
    It demonstrates array declaration, initialization with values, dynamically adding elements to an array, and retrieving the size of an array.
4. [Mappings](examples/4_Mappings.sol)
    
    This contract is a good example of how to organize and manage data in a smart contract, utilizing mappings for efficient key-value storage and structs to represent more complex data.
5. [Conditionals](examples/5_Conditionals.sol)
    
    This contract serves as a basic example of how to manipulate and check data in Solidity, as well as control access based on the sender's address.
6. [HotelRoom](examples/6_HotelRoom.sol)
    
    This contract is a simplified representation of a hotel room booking system, where the room can be booked by sending 2 Ether. Key features demonstrated include:
7. [Secret](examples/7_Secret.sol)
    
    The use of a separate SecretVault contract illustrates a basic form of contract interaction and encapsulation in Solidity.
